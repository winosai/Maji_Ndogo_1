# Maji_Ndogo_1
This project involves solving the water crisis of a hypothetical country called Maji Ndogo using data to draw insights and improve basic access to water using MySQL.
The first sprint of the project involved gaining an understanding of the data, checking each table and the relationship that exists between them, and some data cleaning (fixing errors).
